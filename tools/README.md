# Development Tools

This directory is for development-only utilities such as frame capture, annotation, replay, route validation, diagnostics inspection, and regression-case generation.

Rules:
- tools are not the production application
- production logic should not live only in a tool
- tools should consume the same typed contracts where practical
- captured failure cases should be promotable into tests/fixtures
